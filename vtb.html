<h1>VTR-to-Bitstream</h1>

<p>V2.0 published at FPL 2015, <a href="https://spiral.imperial.ac.uk/bitstream/10044/1/25366/2/fpl15_hung_final.pdf">PDF</a></p>

	<p>
	VTR-to-Bitstream is supplied as a patch for <a href="https://code.google.com/p/vtr-verilog-to-routing/">VTR</a> version 7.0:
	<form><textarea cols="60" rows="2">$ md5sum vtr_release_7.0_full.tar.gz
1997a4a851e75617830016af7e51cdcb  vtr_release_7.0_full.tar.gz</textarea></form>
	Unpack VTR (into the vtr_release/ directory), copy the patch file inside, and then apply the patch by typing:
	<form><textarea cols="60" rows="1">patch -p1 < vtr-to-bitstream_v2.1.patch</textarea></form>
	Currently, this release supports only the xc6vlx240tff1156-1ffg1156 Virtex-6 device found on the popular <a href="http://www.xilinx.com/products/boards-and-kits/EK-V6-ML605-G.htm">ML605 evaluation kit</a>.<br>
	Other devices may be supported in the future, but if you're an eager one, then I'd be happy to assist you in doing so.
	</p>

	Dependencies:<ul>
	<li>Xilinx ISE supporting the ML605 device (full license; WebPack won't cut it, I'm afraid)</li>
	<li><a href="http://torc-isi.sourceforge.net/">Torc</a> (and its <a href="http://torc-isi.sourceforge.net/getting_started.php">dependencies</a>)</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.clifford.at/yosys/">Yosys</a> (and its <a href="https://github.com/cliffordwolf/yosys/blob/master/README">dependencies</a>)</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Once successfully patched, ensure that the Xilinx tools are accessible from the command-line (e.g. xdl),<br>
	and that the Torc and Yosys dependencies are satisfied, then you should be able to just type:
	<form><textarea cols="60" rows="1">make</textarea></form>
	and it should start compiling VTR, download the Torc &amp; Yosys sources and compile those too,<br>
	and then generate build the routing graph for the supported architectures.
	</p>

	<p>To run the entire flow from Verilog to Bitstream, use VTR's own <a href="https://code.google.com/p/vtr-verilog-to-routing/wiki/Run_VTR_Flow">./run_vtr_flow.pl</a> script,<br>
	which has been augmented with a new "bitstream" stage, as well as other nice things.<br>
	After fully placing and routing the design, this new stage performs VTR->XDL translation,<br>
	using a C++ application based on <a href="http://torc-isi.sourceforge.net/">Torc</a>,
	and then calls Xilinx bitgen to generate the bitstream.</p>

	<p>
	Example usage (with the regular VTR (Odin II) front-end) executed from the "vtr_flow/scripts" subdirectory:
	<form><textarea cols="100" rows="1">./run_vtr_flow.pl ../benchmarks/verilog/mkPktMerge.v ../arch/xilinx/xc6vlx240tff1156.xml</textarea></form>
	</p>

	<p>
	Example usage (with the new Yosys front-end):
	<form><textarea cols="100" rows="1">./run_vtr_flow.pl ../benchmarks/verilog/mkPktMerge.v ../arch/xilinx/xc6vlx240tff1156.xml -yosys</textarea></form>
	</p>

	<p>The secret sauce of this project is mainly in three places:<ul>
	<li>bnpr2xdl/bnpr2xdl.{c,h}pp <br>
	A C++ application which reads in the .blif (LUT masks, RAM/DSP instantiations),<br>
	.net (packed netlist), .place (placement locations) and .route (routing switches used)<br>
	output files from VTR and transforms them into <i>precisely</i> into a Xilinx XDL netlist <br>
	that can re-enter the vendor flow.
	<li>xdlrc2vpr/xdlrc2vpr.{c,h}pp <br>
	A different C++ application which reads extracts the Xilinx routing resource graph<br>
	from Torc, and transform that into the VPR coordinate space and data format, so that<br>
	it can be imported directly into memory by VPR
	<li>vtr_flow/arch/xilinx/xc6vlx240tff1156.xml <br>
	VPR7.0 architecture file that describes the Virtex-6 CLB, the precise location of all<br>
	I/O, RAM and DSP columns, as well as empty regions in the fabric.<br>
	Timing numbers for the logic was inferred from the Xilinx STA trce tool,<br>
	and wire/LUT inpin delays have been estimated through linear regression.</ul></p>

	<p>Changelog:<ul>
		<li>v2.1 -- September 2015: Major public release as described in FPL2015 paper;<br>
		The small difference to that which is published in this paper is that the <br>
		"VTB v1" and "route2xdl" parts of the flow (Fig. 3) have been merged and <br> 
		completely rewritten to depend on Torc only.</li>
		<li>v2.0 -- April 2015: Internal release with Yosys and Xilinx routing support</li>
		<li>v1.1 -- October 2013: Minor release; <ul>
			<li> Add example benchmark 'counter.v' (simple fast/slow up/down 8 bit counter)<br>
			To build the counter.v design, enter vtr_flow/scripts and enter:<br>
